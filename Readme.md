The Dists sheet contains seed data from which the simulated measurements are randomly pulled Dists columns are 10,000 normally distributed points having a mean of 0.0 and standard deviation 1.0. The Normal column (A) data were generated in JMP. The Normal2 column B data were generated in Excel using the formula.
